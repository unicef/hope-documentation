# Technology stack and platform
## Modern and robust technology stack

Our open-source software is crafted with a modern technology stack, designed for high performance, flexibility, and ease of contribution. We've thoughtfully selected technology stack that emphasizes scalability, security, and strong community support.

Our backend is powered by Python Django, providing a reliable and scalable foundation where both RESTful and Graph APIs are implemented for fast and easy data exchange and integrations with other parts of the HOPE ecosystem.

The frontend is built using React and HTML5 to create a responsive, dynamic user interface that delivers a seamless experience. The Database is PostgreSQL which provides efficient and reliable data storage.

The code is packaged using Docker so it can be shipped and reusable. We use Kubernetes and Helm charts for deployments to any environment.

We use GitHub for managing code and version control, along with the GitHub Actions for build pipelines for efficient and automated workflows.

Transparency and collaboration are at the core of our approach. Our entire tech stack is open-source and documented, making it easy for anyone to understand and deploy HOPE. Our mission is to build and foster an inclusive community where developers of all skill levels can contribute. Our technology stack embodies our commitment to building a product that is both innovative and accessible to the open-source community
