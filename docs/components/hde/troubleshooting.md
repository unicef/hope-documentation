If you encounter issues while running the service, the **admin panel** can be a useful tool for diagnosing and resolving problems. The admin panel provides access to various configurations, logs, and status indicators that can help identify potential causes of issues.

To efficiently track and monitor errors within the application, **Sentry** is integrated as the primary tool for error logging and alerting.

For Sentry to work correctly, ensure that the **SENTRY_DSN** environment variable is set.
