# CO / User testing

We've broken the proposed testing into two phases.

### Expectations for User Testing \# 1: 

* User testing should cover all workflows for users with the highest permissions. 
* Test users are going to follow testing scenarios and tasks illustrating the day to day work within the system.
* Tasks have to be accepted beforehand by the key project stakeholders. 
* Each task should be performed by several potential users to ensure accurate results. 
* _User testing will base on mockups delivered in Iteration 2._ 
* Ideal process for it \(limitations of time/resources will have to be accommodated\)
  * User testing has to be captured using for example mouse tracking and screen recording software. Evaluation surveys should follow performed testing sessions. 
  * User testing should deliver information on task-completion times, success rates, number of errors, etc. 
  * If possible, user testing should be moderated. 
  * User Testing will be followed with an analysis of gathered data and results will be communicated with everyone involved in the HCT-MIS project. 

### Timeline for User Testing \# 1: 

* _User testing should be done as part of the iteration 2._ 

### Expectations for User Testing \# 2: 

* User Testing no 2 bases on the same expectations as the first one. Although this time, users will be provided with a fully developed system in terms of functional requirements. 

### Timeline for User Testing \# 2 \(UAT\): 

* _User testing has to be done after â€¦... TBD based on development/launch timeline to be determined in future iterations._
