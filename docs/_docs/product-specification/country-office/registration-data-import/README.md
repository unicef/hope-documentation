# Registration Data Import

## Motivation

The Registration Data Import module is the gateway for importing new data to the HCT-MIS database, shared with other applications.

Users will have the ability to import registered data from external tools and applications \(like Kobo\) or a raw import \(via an excel file that follows a specific template\), deduplicate and clean the information in a staging environment before having the ability to accept new data into HCT-MIS database.

## Import

The user can import data in two ways:

* Excel upload \(based on a template provided\)
* Import from 3rd party \(Kobo only for now\).

This import goes into a 'staging area' and not usable for targeting right away.

The states of an import:

* **In Review**
* **Approved**
* **Merged**
