# Grievance & Feedback

## Grievances / Feedback Model

**Purpose**: Module for recording, tracking, and resolving grievances and feedback.

Grievance is made by individual through a call center - changes are drafted by rep. Program Manager will then come back to draft grievances and for final verification. Changes are logged. \(ie: Ben. changes last name &gt; Grievance is made &gt; Account is verified and approved &gt; System logs change\)



## Requirements from InVision Feedback:

> * Multiple individual tickets should be aggregated to a 'case' if they are pertain to the same issues and will likely require a common response. **- AG**
> * The system should ideally be multi channel capable - i.e. info can come from SMS rapid pro system, from a call center or from a physical complaints desk at the distribution site with a digital entry form. We will have to track entry point, location, etc. **- AG**
> * The grievance system needs to have triage logic at the forefront - with categorization:
>   * per sensitivity \(corruption, abuse of power, sexual exploitation or abuse, or data privacy\) with a dedicated fast track escalation system
>   * per urgency, time sensitive \(i.e. issue preventing distribution of aid\)
>   * per type: type of issue **- AG**
> * Timely response for a grievance system is key for participants to feel heard and that their issues are being resolved. So time tracking with ideal response time of xx hours with color coding and persistent reminders is key. **- AG**
