# Registration

## Organization

### RACI

#### **Responsible:**

**Accountable:**

**Consult:**

**Informed:**

## **R.6 Registration Module**

* Minimum required \(CORE\):
  * Household:
    * **Core**
    * _Baseline_
  * Individual:
    * **PII** - Collected only for Focal Point \(ie: Head of Household\)
    * **Vulnerabilities / Demographics**
    * _Baseline_

## Requirement:

* **R.7** - Ability to add custom fields.
* Ability to edit content on forms.
* Ability to make custom field a child of another field \(previous field\).
* Specific to the Programme Level
* **R.8** - Mobile ready and Accessible, Responsive, 
* **R.9** - Self-service Authentication Management
  * Online first, then can go offline.
  * Both Unicef and Partners to authenticate. 
* **R10** - Offline Sync Capabilities:
  * Wifi / 3G data connection.
  *  Class 1 confidentiality
  * Ability based on R/P of user to pull Ben. Data.
* **R11** - Function Offline in Low-Bandwidth Situation
  * Delete locally stored beneficiary data after the devices receives confirmation from the server as sync completes.
* **R35** - Unique IDs
* **R12** - Biometrics
  * Stored on SmartChip

### RISKS:

* Changing criteria mid-program may cause issue with data\(?\)
* Online/Offline Sync Data duplication - Manual Sync vs. Auto Sync.
* Duplicate Households being registered.
  * Check if already in system.
  * Offline will not be able to check.
    * Perhaps associate \(link\) to existing Household.
* Importing Govt list could prove difficult - would just need to add source data as custom fields - _See data mgmt_
* Criteria for creating new Intervention - to avoid collecting all data under a single intervention.
* Common data criteria imported...

### IDEAS:

* Note on registration for suggested aide - IE: Visit is for Nutrition - but notice no water.

After 1 year's time, the fields will need to be reviewed for updating.

Focal Points will need a secondary \(representative\) member appointed.

Representatives of focal point may not be a part of the household. Need to identify this.

#### Household Vulnerabilities

* See Data Lake - Data Dictionary
* Fields will be a pick list.

#### Household Baseline

* 1/15 families surveyed should be set as baseline criteria.

#### Save Form

* Ability to save draft of form before saving.

Interventions

* Bens. need to be recorded in a way to prevent duplication among households
* **No-Pay List** - Beneficiaries listed as already receiving funds. Similar to a blacklist.

#### Household ID

#### Individual ID

#### Identification Document Type

### Suggestions:

* **O**pen **D**ata **K**it

### INVISION FEEDBACK:

> * For the 'biometric enabled' functions, ideally we would have place holders for elements like pictures, or biometric templates. **- AG**
> * For picture, we have had various instance of projects where we registered the picture of the HoHH and Alternate so that would have to be considered already.  **- GE**
> * There will be rapid response intervention where we wont register all the HH members yet we will start with the transfer, it would be good to have the flexibility to consider complete a HH even when there is only partial info from some members **- GE**
> * for the mobile app, there should be a button for saving and a button for pushing the survey to the system right?
