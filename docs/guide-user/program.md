# Program 

The Programme Management module is used for defining objectives and basic programme information to be matched with assistance records for reporting purposes. This module involves defining the framework within which all aspects of a humanitarian cash transfer can be created and managed. Creating a programme involves defining a programme name, code, duration, sector, scope, description, geographical area of implementation and frequency of payment. The Programme set up process also includes a step to assign Partners to the Programme. This step is optional and should only be used by country offices willing to “segregate” the view of partners or UNICEF sections to PII of a given programme (commonly referred to as Ringfencing). In this area Partner access can be restricted further by administrative areas. In case no ringfencing is required Partners would be assigned access to the whole business area.
