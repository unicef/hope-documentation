### **Iteration 1 Deliverables**

We have broken the deliverables for Iteration one into product, technical and design.

####  **Product / Project Management Deliverables**

The goal of Iteration One is to have a high level understanding of the entire project’s components \(Modules\) and enough information to formulate projections to enable internal / external teams to coordinate based on availability and responsibility.   
****

* Kickoff to begin solution discovery and technical/functional design
* Kickoff workshop with EMOPS and ICTD
* Establish Team Roles & Responsibilities for internal & external \(project\) team\(s\). See organization & governance below.
* Define minimal requirements for project team organization \(documentation\) and communications \(meetings\). 
* Start initial functional/technical conversations on integration with CashAssist, VISION.
* Establish User Story/ticket/bug format and generation in Clubhouse along with prioritization and establishment of epics.
* Plan out iteration 2 and 3 stories, refining existing plan that was proposed. These would be iterations in Clubhouse.
* Establish initial documentation in Gitbook and ensure that its delivered at the end of iteration with content which is reflective of all the deliverables in this iteration, whether embedded in it or linked to the right external resource.

####  **Technical Architecture Deliverables**

During this iteration, Tivix will break ground on structuring and establishing the initial project codebase.  


* Establish core data model. This will be shared via a lucid charts link and included in the documentation.
* Technical research/prototyping of/looking into offline capabilities for the registration module, JSON field handling, API \(DRF or GraphQL\) etc.. This would be reflected in the technical documentation of possible solutions with pros and cons; concluded with the recommended option
* Initial DevOps / technical architecture and tools finalized including CI/CD tool, cloud infra requirements etc.
* Scaffold the initial project codebase on Github. This would be a docker compose setup, along with backend/frontend services.

#### **UX / UI Design Deliverables**

Tivix will provide UX / Interface Designers to begin conducting research and producing high level components around the system users and the system’s interface.  


* User Personas for the system.
* Establish v1 user flows for all the core modules.
* Modules that enable monitoring i.e Grievances, Payment Verification, Cash+ and Reporting can be designed and developed in a later iterations.
* High Level Site/Product map. This and the above items may be delivered via a Miro board or similar to foster and ensure collaboration and distribution of the content.
* Clickable \(v1\) mockup covering all core modules at a high level to help drive clarity and conversation. This will be delivered via Invision.
