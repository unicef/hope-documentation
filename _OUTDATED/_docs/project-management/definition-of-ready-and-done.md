# Definition of Ready/Done

## Definition of Ready

To align the team on expectations for building new features, it is important to be consistent with the definition of ready. 

Tickets are created as pieces of functionality to support a larger goal. Tickets should always include the following:

Tickets are created as pieces of functionality to support a larger goal. Tickets should always include the following:

* Clear understanding of what is to be done
  * Descriptive title
  * Use Case
  * Acceptance criteria
  * Validation rules 
* Clear understanding of what is to be done
* Descriptive title
* Use Case / description
* Acceptance criteria
* Validation rules 
* Links to specifications / designs as appropriate

Establish team understanding that as each person accepts a ticket to work on, they are taking ownership of the full quality of the deliverable. PMs will do their part to make the ticket clear but the engineer is ultimately responsible for the critical thinking and high quality of their deliverables. Common sense details should always be applied through thoughtfulness of each team member.

## Definition of Done

To align the team on expectations of the feature lifecycle, it is important to understand the definition of done. This supports the step to "Set Expectations" both within the team and for Clients. 

Here is our definition of done for features / stories:

Tickets are created as pieces of functionality to support a larger goal. These tickets are assigned to a specific team member who is responsible for owning the ticket through delivery. This means that once a ticket is completed and merged, it is only partially done. The definition of done is that the ticket is functioning as expected into a staging environment. 

* Acceptance criteria is met
* Documentation does exist
* Tests do exist
  * \*\*\*\*[**Unit Tests**](../technical-specification/development-setup/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing) for backend
  * functional / e2e tests where appropriate
* All tests must pass
* Code has been demoed on local or live\(dev/staging\) instance
* Code has been reviewed by one peer, for features / critical bug fixes
* Code meets coding guidelines
* Code is checked in

Team members have all agreed to verify the work they have delivered is working as expected both locally and in the staging environment. This will be done as soon as the team is notified that staging has been deployed. 

Failure to complete the steps as described here will lead to low quality of work and potentially numerous bugs. This will cause the QA engineer and all stakeholders more work so it is best that the team member responsible for the work complies.
